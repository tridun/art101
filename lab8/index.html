    <h1>Lab 8 - Anonymous and Callback Functions</h1>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>

  	<p>The challenge of this assignment was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>

    <p>The issues that we came across for this assignment occurred when we tried
     to attempt the second part of the bonus task. We were able to print out the
     JavaScript file on our page but each new line would replace the previous
     one. We were only able to see Test 3 get printed out in delayed intervals due
    to the setTimeOut() function.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

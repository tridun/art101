			Hi, my name is Tristan Dunlop and I'm a third year AGPM major at UCSC.
			Prior to ART 101, I have had some programming experience with C and Java,
			but none when it comes to HTML and CSS. To help experiment and encourage
			myself to learn more, I decided that it would be best to make this site a
			small digital portfolio of my art work.

		<h2>Experience</h2>

		<p>
			From an early age, I've played around with a lot of different mediums,
			from pencil sketching to acrylic painting, but in recent years, I have
			experimented with more non-traditional art forms such as duct-tape,
			spray paint, welding, and digital art.

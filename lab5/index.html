		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge of this assignment was to work with a a partner to
				experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.
			</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				There was some difficulty dealing with Chrome's Javascript console,
				because it was a little unforgiving in terms of not being able to edit
				previous lines. However, typing it up in Atom was much easier.

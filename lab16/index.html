      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>For a while, nothing was printing out, no image, no text, no altmessage, nada.
      I kept getting a CORS error message. I realized it was because I didn't have my CORS unblocker
     Chrome Extension activated; I had previously installed it but it hadn't occurred to me that you
   actually had to turn it on. Other than that, there were a few hiccups, however, they were all minor
 because Brock helped me out a lot during section.</p>
